# Agent access layer

The access layer lets a remote personal agent (for example Grok Bot or Dot) drive the Codex and Claude CLIs that live on the HarnessOrbit host. The agent never gets a shell: it submits a job, HarnessOrbit dispatches it through the normal `dispatch → collect → verify` pipeline in an isolated Git worktree, and the agent polls for status until something needs a decision.

This is phase one. It ships three tools (`describe`, `submit`, `status`) over the Model Context Protocol and the same three as CLI subcommands. Approval, answering a blocked worker, cancellation, events, and result fetching come next; `status` already reports the attention items those tools will act on.

## Topology

```text
Grok Bot (cloud)  --MCP over Streamable HTTP-->  tunnel or tailnet  -->  127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp
                                                                         access serve
                                                                           └─ Orchestrator → Herdr → claude | codex
Dot (sandbox)     --shell-->  harnessorbit access submit|status  (same service, no network)
```

- The server binds loopback only. You expose it with your own tunnel (cloudflared, ngrok) or a private network (Tailscale). HarnessOrbit never opens a public port.
- Every call authenticates with a principal token in `Authorization: Bearer`. There is no anonymous access.
- The host keeps authoritative state in `run.json` as always. Jobs only map a principal's request to a run and a task.
- Nothing reaches the project checkout until integration, which this phase leaves to the host operator (`harnessorbit integrate`).

## Principals

A principal is one remote caller with a scope.

```sh
node bin/harnessorbit.mjs access principal create --id grok \
  --project /path/to/repo[,/another/repo] --agents codex,claude --label "Grok Bot"
```

The command prints the token once. HarnessOrbit stores only its SHA-256 in `<state>/access/principals.json`. Fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `projects` | Absolute directories (realpath) the principal may submit work for. Anything else is `project_not_allowed`. |
| `agents` | Which local CLIs it may choose. The first one is the default. |
| `permissions` | `submit`, `cancel` default on; `integrate` default off (`--allow-integrate` to enable, used by the upcoming `approve` tool). |
| `rateLimitPerMinute` | Token bucket for write tools on the MCP server. Default 60. |

`access principal list` and `access principal remove --id ID` manage them.

## Serving

```sh
node bin/harnessorbit.mjs access serve --port 7777
```

The command prints `{ endpoint, port, pid }` and stays in the foreground until Ctrl-C. Run it in tmux. Then publish the endpoint:

- **Tailscale**: `tailscale serve --bg 7777` on the host; the remote agent uses the tailnet URL. Preferred, no public exposure.
- **cloudflared**: a named tunnel pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:7777`; the remote agent uses the stable hostname.

Register the URL as a custom MCP connector on the agent's side with a fixed header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### Protocol

- Transport: Streamable HTTP, JSON responses only (no SSE stream, no sessions). `POST /mcp` with one JSON-RPC 2.0 message per request; batches are rejected.
- Methods: `initialize` (protocol versions 2025-06-18, 2025-03-26, 2024-11-05), `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`. Notifications return 202.
- A request with a non-loopback `Origin` header is rejected; browsers are not clients.
- Tool failures come back as `isError: true` with `{ code, message, details }`, never as HTTP errors, so the agent can read them.
- Tools return within 20 seconds (`tool_timeout` otherwise). Long work never blocks a call; `status` polls it.

## Tools

### `describe`

Returns the principal's scope, limits, the submit contract, and the lifecycle (states, attention kinds, next actions). Agents should call it first.

### `submit`

```json
{
  "idempotencyKey": "room-6ac9…-msg-42",
  "project": "/Users/me/repo",
  "objective": "Make add() add its inputs; keep existing tests passing.",
  "context": "User reported add(3,4) returns -1. tests/math.test.mjs already encodes the expected behaviour.",
  "agent": "codex",
  "allowedPaths": ["src/math.mjs"],
  "checks": [{ "name": "tests", "argv": ["node", "--test", "tests/math.test.mjs"], "timeoutMs": 60000 }],
  "brief": { "taskKind": "bugfix", "risk": "low" },
  "conversationKey": "6ac9ebe094c081a28db48ac493ac0dc2"
}
```

- `idempotencyKey` is required. A repeated key returns the original job (`job.reused: true`) instead of dispatching again, so a caller whose request timed out can safely retry.
- `context` is required. It is handed to the worker as native instructions; a bare objective is not accepted.
- `checks` is required and nonempty. HarnessOrbit runs them itself against the candidate; the agent's own claim of success is not trusted.
- `allowedPaths` defaults to the whole project. Directory scopes must end with `/`. Worktree isolation is always used; `checkout` is not offered to principals.
- `conversationKey` is stored for correlation only. It is never used for authentication.
- Each job is its own run (`runId === job.id`, task id `main`), so project-level holds and capacity rules from the orchestrator still apply.

If dispatch fails after the job was recorded (for example Herdr is down), the job is kept with `state: attention`, `attention[0].kind: retry`, and the same idempotency key keeps returning it.

### `status`

Input `{ jobId }`. Besides reading, it moves the job forward: a running worker is collected, a submitted candidate is verified (up to three stages per call; the CLI waits for them, the server runs them in the background and reports the state it already knows). Output:

```json
{
  "state": "attention",
  "job": { "id": "job-…", "runId": "job-…", "taskId": "main", "agent": "codex", "reused": false },
  "attempt": { "status": "accepted", "number": 1, "changedPaths": ["src/math.mjs"], "verification": { "checks": [{ "name": "tests", "status": "passed" }] }, "lastError": null, "retryAdvice": null },
  "attention": [{ "kind": "integrate", "target": ["src/math.mjs"], "risk": "low", "since": "…", "how": "This principal cannot integrate. The host operator runs integrate on the host." }],
  "attention_pending": 1,
  "next_action": "approve"
}
```

States: `dispatching`, `running`, `attention`, `integrated`, `cancelled`. Attention kinds: `integrate`, `input`, `out_of_scope_write`, `retry`, `integration_recovery`. `next_action` is one of `status`, `approve`, `answer`, `retry`, `result`, `operator`, `none`. A caller polls only while `next_action` is `status`.

## CLI path (same-host agents)

An agent that lives on the same machine as HarnessOrbit, such as Dot inside its own sandbox, needs no network: it runs the subcommands directly, scoped to a principal by id.

```sh
node bin/harnessorbit.mjs access describe --principal dot
node bin/harnessorbit.mjs access submit   --principal dot --file job.json
node bin/harnessorbit.mjs access status   --principal dot --job job-… [--no-advance]
```

Each call returns the same JSON as the MCP tool. `status` advances inline, so it may take as long as the verification checks; pass `--no-advance` for a pure read.

## Audit

Every call appends one line to `<state>/access/audit.jsonl`: time, principal, transport (`mcp` or `cli`), tool, job id, outcome, duration. Request bodies and tokens are never written. This file is how the host operator sees what a remote agent asked for.

## Not in this phase

- `approve`, `answer`, `retry`, `cancel`, `result`, `events`, and `fetch_patch` tools.
- A doorbell webhook from the host to the agent.
- A headless runtime for hosts without Herdr.
- OAuth. Fixed bearer headers are what Grok's custom connectors support today; OAuth is added only if a target platform requires it.
